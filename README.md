# Grade-Calculator
<b>Ryan Zimmer and Ian Wilson</b><br>
Our goal is to create a comprehensive grade calculator for college students. Ideally at the beginning of the semester, the student would look through the syllabus and assign different weights for different categories of assignments, quizzes and tests. As the semester progresses, the student proceeds to enter their grades into the program and can check their current average at any time. This program would save time and ensure accuracy as opposed to traditional methods of calculating grades by hand. Students can experiment with upcoming tests and see how the result affects their final score.
The program would have to read and write scores and store them in different files for each class the student is taking, and be able to access the scores when required. The program would need to be able to calculate averages, and would need to be able to perform multiplication and addition operations. The program would need to calculate the average scores in each category, multiply the average score percent by the total number of points available per category, and then sum up the numbers to present the student with a total score out of 100. Weighted grades and averages may also be required. 
Each person will have to work closely with each other, and check each other’s work as their will be a lot of “moving” parts in this project. Each person will be responsible for either the structure of the program, or the user interface side of the program. Both sides of this project will require input from the other and will require close cooperation in order for the program to be successful.
